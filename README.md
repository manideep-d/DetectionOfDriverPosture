# DetectionOfDriverPosture

Abstract: -
The distraction of drivers from the safe driving position is considered one of the major reasons for most road accidents. In this below project I am going to use some deep learning models to detect the position of a driver and classify the posture of a driver. The dataset is obtained from the kaggle which has 10 different classes of driver positions. The models used in this project are state of art algorithm VGG-16 and another CNN model. VGG-16 has obtained an accuracy of 96% and the CNN model has obtained an accuracy of 99%.
